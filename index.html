<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The first few years of a child’s life provide the building blocks for lifelong learning and health. While Louisville has a large ecosystem of people, businesses, and organizations that support early childhood development, many families across Louisville face barriers to accessing those resources.</p>
<p>This report analyzes one way to evaluate early childhood development, kindergarten readiness, as well as some of the factors that impact it: the cost and availability of childcare, adverse childhood experiences, and food security. We chose these data points based on community interest and with the hope to highlight topics for which local data is not widely available.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, we analyze the connection between race, geography, and early childhood development. Louisville’s early childhood system does not support all populations equally as a result of institutional racism, residential segregation, discriminatory policies, and many other factors. In support of <a href="https://apathforward4lou.org/">A Path Forward</a>, we focus on Black children in particular. However, structural racism does not just affect Black children, and exclusionary polices affect people based on more identities than just their race and ethnicity. While we provide some data that extends beyond race, data for other races and populations in our community is often limited, a problem in its own right.</p>
<p>The Greater Louisville Project created this report in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.readyforkalliance.com/">ReadyforK Alliance</a>, whose vision is that all children enter kindergarten ready to thrive. We measure our community’s success in this area through kindergarten readiness.</p>
</div>
<div id="kindergarten-readiness" class="section level1">
<h1>Kindergarten Readiness</h1>
<p>Kindergarten readiness is an important indicator of whether children will succeed in the classroom. Kentucky school districts evaluate kindergarten readiness using the <a href="https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/learning/ready4k">BRIGANCE Early Childhood Kindergarten Screen III</a>, which assesses child development across five areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic/Cognitive Development</li>
<li>Language Development</li>
<li>Physical Development</li>
<li>Self-help Skills</li>
<li>Social and Emotional Skills</li>
</ul>
<p>The BRIGANCE screener asks children to perform tasks such as identifying letters, numbers, and shapes or using a writing utensil. Parents provide information on their child’s self-help, social, and emotional skills such as whether their child can dress themselves, communicate their feelings, or take turns with other children. The results are a strong indicator of a student’s future academic performance. Based on <a href="https://kystats.ky.gov/Reports/Tableau/ECP_2020">data from KySTATS</a>, JCPS students who entered school ready for kindergarten in 2016 were over three times as likely to achieve test results at or above their grade level on their standardized K-PREP math and reading tests in the 3rd grade. This is true for both JCPS students as a whole as well as Black JCPS students in particular.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the BRIGANCE screener has limitations. For example, children in professional care facilities are more likely to receive instruction tailored to the BRIGRANCE screener than children in a home setting with their parents or a relative. While many of the topics and questions represent important developmental foundations, child development includes factors beyond just the questions in BRIGANCE. It’s important to communicate the topics in BRIGRANCE to all families as well as ensure the questions in BRIGRANCE are not culturally biased.</p>
<p>You can see some of the questions included in BRIGANCE here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Documents/BRIGANCE%20academic%20language%20phyical.pdf">Example child assessment (academic, language, and physical measures)</a></li>
<li><a href="Documents/BRIGANCE-%20Parent%20ReportShSE%20Scales%20English%20-%20interactive.pdf">Example parent report (self-help, social, and emotional skills)</a></li>

<div id="overall-readiness" class="section level2">
<h2>Overall Readiness</h2>
<p>Since JCPS began tracking kindergarten readiness in 2012-13, overall readiness levels have fluctuated up to five percentage points per year, but they have remained largely the same. Other Kentucky students have seen their scores slightly increase.</p>

<div id="race" class="section level2">
<h2>Race</h2>
<p>Racial disparities in kindergarten readiness have been largely persistent since the 2012-13 school year. The kindergarten readiness gap between Black students and white students shrank from 12 points in 2012-13 to around 5 points in 2016-17 before growing again. As of the 2018-19 school year, scores for the four groups included here are all within five points of their original levels.</p>

<h2>Prior Setting</h2>
<p>The largest differences among student groups are based on prior setting.</p>
<p>Children who were in licensed childcare providers prior to entering school are most likely to be kindergarten ready, while children who stayed at home with a parent or guardian are least likely to be kindergarten ready.</p>
<p>Children who were previously enrolled in Head Start, a State-funded preschool program, or were in another home setting such as a private sitter or other family member (labeled “Other”), fall in the middle.</p>

<h2>Race and Prior setting</h2>
<p>Combining the analysis by race and prior setting shows which settings are most effective at ensuring all children enter kindergarten ready to learn. The years on the graph below reflect the spring semester of when a student entered kindergarten. (For example, 2019-2020 is labeled 2020.)</p>
<p>Among the groups we examine here, the smallest racial disparities exist among children who were previously enrolled in Head Start or state-funded preschool. This is likely due to the fact that families must meet certain income limits to enroll their children in these programs, so children in these programs come from families with common economic situations. However, it is still important to note that Black and Brown children in these settings enter kindergarten with relatively high readiness rates, and they have seen improvements since 2013-14.</p>
<p>Students in professional childcare settings are the most kindergarten ready, however, racial disparities for these children are wider than for all children. As will be discussed later, this reflects differences in access to affordable and high-quality childcare.</p>
<p>Differences in kindergarten readiness among children who were previously in a home setting with their parents (Home) or in another home-based setting (Other) are difficult to interpret because it reflects a wide variety of experiences for children. On average, children who were previously at home with their parents enter kindergarten the least ready to learn.</p>

<h1>Early Childcare</h1>
<p>Children in a professional childcare setting enter kindergarten with the highest levels of kindergarten readiness. However, childcare is not affordable or accessible for many families.</p>
<p>Using data from <a href="https://kynect.ky.gov/benefits/s/child-care-provider?language=en_US">kynect</a>, we examine the cost and availability of childcare using information from childcare providers. While providers should update their information anytime it changes, some data is not current, and many childcare centers are in flux due to COVID-19. However, the kynect database is linked to the state registration system, and it is the most comprehensive source available at this time.</p>
<p>While our data examines the total licensed capacity of childcare providers, the number of available childcare slots is smaller. Many providers have smaller actual capacity to maintain quality standards, due to issues retaining staff, or due to temporary barriers due to COVID-19.</p>
<div id="cost" class="section level2 tabset">
<h2 class="tabset">Cost</h2>
<p>The median cost of childcare for one toddler is $8,710 per year, approximately 15% of the median family income for Jefferson County in 2019. We report daily rates in the charts below because that is the format provided by kynect. The median annual rate of $8,710 corresponds to a daily rate of $33.50.</p>

<h3>Full-Time Care</h3>
<p>The chart below shows the estimated number of full-time childcare slots by daily price in Louisville.</p>
<p>Based on kynect data, the total number of licensed childcare slots for children of all ages is 31,597. Most of these slots are licensed to be available children of all age ranges, but we estimate the actual utilization of childcare slots by age group based on data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. For example, the number of licensed slots available for infants is over 20,000, however the vast majority of those slots are used by children of other ages for whom they are also licensed.</p>

<h3>Part-Time Care</h3>
<p>The chart below shows the estimated number of part-time childcare slots by daily price in Louisville.</p>
<p>Based on kynect data, the total number of licensed childcare slots for children of all ages is 31,597. Most of these slots are licensed to be available children of all age ranges, but we estimate the actual utilization of childcare slots by age group based on data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. For example, the number of licensed slots available for infants is over 20,000, however the vast majority of those slots are used by children of other ages for whom they are also licensed.</p>

<p>The map below shows the location of the 395 licensed childcare providers throughout the city. Mouse over the map to see provider information.</p>
<p>The size of the circle indicates the number of licensed slots, and the color of the circle indicates the provider’s <a href="https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dcbs/dcc/Pages/kyallstars.aspx">Kentucky All STARS quality rating</a> based on family engagement, classroom quality, and staff qualifications. Level 1 is the default level indicating the provider is in good standing, and providers can choose to be evaluated to potentially earn a higher rating. Most providers go unrated and remain at level 1, and the data does not distinguish between unrated and rated level 1 providers. However, providers at levels 2 and above have been evaluated and certified to meet certain standards.</p>
<p>Providers of all ratings can be found throughout the city. Looking at the distribution of quality ratings by neighborhood, there are no discernible trends. A larger issue is the general access to quality care: there are only three 5-STAR providers in Louisville, and only 107 out of 395 providers have more than one star.</p>

<h3>Providers by Neighborhood</h3>
<p>Unlike STAR ratings, there are patterns in terms of the distribution of childcare slots throughout Louisville. The map below shows the number of childcare slots available to children ages 0 to 4 by neighborhood. The highest availability is located around Downtown, Old Louisville, and the University of Louisville. This likely reflects the large number of people who commute to work in this area and use nearby childcare. These neighborhoods are the only two where there are more slots available than children who live there.</p>
<p>The lowest availability of childcare is in neighborhoods at the very Southwest and West of the city: Fairdale and Valley Station in the South Louisville, and Chickasaw, Shawnee, and Portland in West Louisville.</p>
<p>These groupings have been created from Census data and reflect general areas.</p>

<p>The neighborhoods with the highest availability of childcare tend to be neighborhoods with a predominantly white population. As a result, parents of Black and Brown are more likely to have difficulty accessing childcare due to where they live.</p>

<h2>Adverse Childhood Experiences</h2>
<p><strong>Adverse childhood experiences are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood. If you would prefer to skip past this section, you can do so by clicking “Child Food Security” in the sidebar.</strong></p>
<p>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) include forms of abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction. According to the CDC, “ACEs can have lasting, negative effects on health, well-being, and opportunity.” In 2018, 71% of Louisville adults reported experiencing one or more ACEs during their childhood.</p>

<p>ACEs data was collected by the Kentucky BRFSS survey using phone interviews throughout 2018. Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). <em>Kentucky Behavioral Risk Factor Survey Data - Adverse Childhood Experiences 2015&amp;2018.</em> Frankfort, Kentucky: Cabinet for Health and Family Services, Kentucky Department for Public Health, <strong>[2018]</strong>.</p>

<h3>Impact of ACEs</h3>
<p>Louisville adults who have experienced a high number of ACEs report much higher numbers of chronic disease than those who experienced no ACEs. The chart below compares the prevalence of several healh conditions among the two groups. The data is based on the health status of current adults based on the number of ACEs they report having experienced as a child.</p>
<p>Compared to adults who experienced no ACEs, adults who experienced a high number of ACEs are 6.5 times as likely to be a current smoker, 2.2 times as likely to report poor health status, 6.3 times as likely o have had a heart attack, and 3.9 times as likely to have depression.</p>

<h3>ACEs by race</h3>
<p>The most recent national data from the National Survey of Children’s Health shows that <a href="https://www.cahmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/aces_fact_sheet.pdf">children who are Hispanic or Black are more likely to have experienced one or more ACEs</a>. While we have some local data for children of different races, it is limited and highly variable from year to year. The original ACEs questionnaire mostly measures trauma that occurs in the home, and it excludes many kinds of trauma that are most likely to affect Black and Brown children, such as racial discrimination from peers, experiences with community violence, and family separation.</p>
<p>There are various proposals to create a more comprehensive Expanded or Culturally-Informed ACEs measure. Some suggestions include adding questions about community experiences, such as witnessing violence or living in unsafe neighborhoods. Proposals also include collecting more data on experiences with racism, including discrimination, stigma, and historical trauma. Racism is both a source of trauma and an amplifier of other kinds of trauma.</p>

<h3>Breakdown by Program Eligibility</h3>
<p>As of 2018, Feeding America estimated that most food-insecure children lived in families under 185% of the poverty line, meaning that they were generally eligible for programs like SNAP, WIC, and Free or Reduced School lunch.</p>
<p>Compared to cities with similar rates of overall child food insecurity, Louisville has a relatively low number of food insecure children who are eligible for food benefit programs and a relatively high number of food insecure children above this cutoff. This shows that food insecurity is prevalent in families with a wide range of incomes.</p>
